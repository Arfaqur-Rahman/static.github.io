						<div><h3>Overview:</h3>
						<p>Chester Bennington was one of the lead singers of the legendary rock band, ‘Linkin Park’, best known for his trademark high pitched voice that mesmerized a countless number of Linkin Park fans. What made him particularly special was the fact that he had risen to glory after facing innumerable challenges and struggles in his early life. Bennington’s childhood was far from rosy. His parents divorced when he was very young and he became a victim of sexual abuse. As a teenager, he took to the habit of drugs to deal with emotional distress and worked many jobs in order to pay for his drug habit. He was a lonely youngster and hardly had any friends. It was this loneliness that slowly started feeding his passion for music and he soon became a part of his first band, ‘Sean Dowdell and His Friends?’ He later joined the band, ‘Grey Daze’. His career as a musician took off after he auditioned to be a part of the band ‘Linkin Park’. The blockbuster reception of the band’s debut album, ‘Hybrid Theory’ catapulted Bennington’s position as a musician and gave him the much-needed and deserved recognition as one of the most iconic figures of music in the 21st century.</p>
